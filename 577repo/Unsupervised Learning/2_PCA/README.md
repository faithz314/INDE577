PCA

In this notebook, we will focus on PCA, or Principal Component Analysis. This is a dimensionality reduction technique to simplify complexities and reduce the number of features, while preserving important original information. By reducing the dimensionality, PCA makes it easier to visualize the relationships between features of the data. It considers the covariance of datapoints and eigenvalues, which we will get into a bit later! 

Unsupervised learning is a powerful tool, so let's jump into it!
