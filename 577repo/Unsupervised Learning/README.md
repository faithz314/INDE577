PCA

Welcome to unsupervised learning, or PCA specifically! My linear algebra and statistics classes finally come to use here.

Unsupervised learning is ML when we're training a model on unlabled data. That is, there doesn't exist neat input and ouput pairs required of supervised learning. Despite the name, unsupervised learning is just a prerequisite step to supervised learning. Once patterns, relationships, and insights are found within the data, supervised learning techniques can then be performed. 

In this notebook, we will focus on PCA, or Principal Component Analysis. This is a dimensionality reduction technique to simplify complexities and reduce the number of features, while preserving important original information. By reducing the dimensionality, PCA makes it easier to visualize the relationships between features of the data. It considers the covariance of datapoints and eigenvalues, which we will get into a bit later! 

Unsupervised learning is a powerful tool, so let's jump into it!
