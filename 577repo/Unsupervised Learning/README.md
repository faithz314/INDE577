# Unsupervised Learning

Welcome to unsupervised learning! My linear algebra and statistics classes finally come to use here.

Unsupervised learning is ML when we're training a model on unlabled data. That is, there doesn't exist neat input and ouput pairs required of supervised learning. Despite the name, unsupervised learning is just a prerequisite step to supervised learning. Once patterns, relationships, and insights are found within the data, supervised learning techniques can then be performed. 

I think this graphic kind of summarizes unsupervised machine learning pretty well:

The primary goal of tihs technique is to explore and understand the underlying structure of the data. Like the image above, clustering of data points that are similar to each other is a common way to determine labels that do not currently exist. Other techniques such as dimensionality reduction, density estimation, and anomaly detection can also be utilized to better understand raw data.

Unsupervised learning is particularly practical for navigating large datasets, where labelling data manually is pretty impractical. It is widely used across various fields like data mining, image processing, recommendation systems, and so on.

So, let's begin!
