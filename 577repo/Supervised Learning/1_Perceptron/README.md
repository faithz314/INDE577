# The Perceptron!

The Perceptron is a single neuron model that is used for binary classifcation tasks. It is one of the simplest forms of artificial neural networks. It consists of inputs, weights associated with the inputs, a pre-activation function, and post-activation function to produce an ouput. It will classify an input into 1 of 2 possible categories based on a decision boundary. Althouhg it can only classify linearly separable data, it is the basis for much of machine learning. 

In this notebook, we will be implementing the perceptron on the Palmers Penguin dataset, classifying types of penguins by bill qualities. Read a more detailed description within the notebook itself!
