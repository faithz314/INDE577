Neural Networks!

A single neuron is cool, but the human brain is made up of millions of neurons that help it function. This is the idea behind a neural network.

Dense Neural Networks, or Multilayer Perceptrons, is a parametric model of supervised learning used for both classification and regression problems. They are deep and dense because they are composed of many connected layers of single neurons, where a network of connections exist between them. They take in weights and biases, like the Perceptron, just many more!

Similarly, neural networks use a version of gradient descent as well as a version of cost difference minimization (dubbed backpropogation), varied to fit the nature of the connection density. 

Excitingly, different activation functions can be used, particularly for learning nonlinear relationships between data points. 

This notebook will include a detailed explanation of the model and will contain an application to the heart attack data set!
