# Supervised Learning

Welcome to our tour of machine learning! We begin with Supervised Learning, which is one of the big categories of ML. Supervised learning uses an already labeled dataset to predict outcomes and recognize patterns. Given the labeled datasets, supervised learning algorithms can train on them and learn the relationships between inputs and outputs. Here is an image that visualizes the process:
