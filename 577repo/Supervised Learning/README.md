# Supervised Learning

Welcome to our tour of machine learning! We begin with Supervised Learning, which is one of the big categories of ML. Supervised learning uses an already labeled dataset to predict outcomes and recognize patterns. Given the labeled datasets, supervised learning algorithms can train on them and learn the relationships between inputs and outputs. Here is an image that visualizes the process:

# Types of Supervised Learning

Throughout this repository, we will focus on two main types of machine learning problems. 

First, we will look at classification problems. In classification, we are given a datapoint and we are trying to categorize it. Binary classification problems are the simplest (i.e.: classification between 2 category lables), but we can also do multiclass classification with algorithms as they get more complex.




Next, we wil look at regression problems. In regression, the ouput variable is continuous and within the domain of real numbers. The goal of regression is to learn a function that predicts an ouput given input variables.
