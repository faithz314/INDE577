# Decision Trees

A decision tree is a hierarchical model, like a tree, using decision rules to predict the value of a target variable. 

Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, and they can be visualized as well. It requires little data preparation and is very flexible to different types of datasets. However, they are prone to overfitting and creating overly complex trees, and predictions can end up being not smooth.

Decision trees remind me a lot of concepts I have learned in my previous classes- the branch and bound technique from my optimization class, or recursive trees in discrete structures and algorithms. Once again, decision making comes back into play here in machine learning.

In this notebook, you will find a much more descriptive explanation of a decision tree as well as an interesting analysis on the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
