The Perceptron!!

The Perceptron is a single neuron model that is used for binary classifcation tasks. It is one of the simplest forms of artificial neural networks. It consists of inputs, weights associated with the inputs, a pre-activation function, and post-activation function to produce an ouput. It will classify an input into 1 of 2 possible categories based on a decision boundary. Althouhg it can only classify linearly separable data, it is the basis for much of machine learning.
